# 2018/19 Semester 2 ENGG1340 Course Project (Group 9)

### Group members
- Sean Chok (3035551644)
- Janvi Sharma (3035552894)

### Problem Statement
Janvi is a startup CEO, who is running Nord Etoile, a personal care & fragrance store. Like any other startup (which is always short on cash), Nord Etoile faces deep troubles with its human resources department; that is, its HR manager and software / hardware developer, Sean always has headaches recording, finding, editing, and removing employee information because he has STML. Clearly, something must be done to provide a remedy. This is where a comprehensive employee management system (written in C++) comes in.

### Problem Setting
Some problems faced by Sean are:
1. How to easily maintain a record of all employees?
2. How to look for a specific record of an employee?
3. How to know whether an employee is a current employee or has been fired?
4. How to effectively edit the details of the employee?
5. How to find out which employees earn more than a specific employee?


### Program Features
The program will be menu driven, and it will contain the following features:
1. Create record of a new employee with details such as ID, name, age, role & salary. Adding this record to the current record of employees.
2. Search for a specific record via employee ID, name, age or role.
3. Display the list of all employees with job status (currently working or fired).
4. Edit the details of a current employee.
5. Fire an employee, update this status in the record of all employees.
6. Search for all employees with salary greater than a specific entered record.
